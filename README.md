# Kidney-Disease-Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying kidney disease.
The implementation integrates MLflow for experiment tracking, DVC (Data Version Control) for managing datasets and pipelines, and a CI/CD pipeline for deployment to AWS using GitHub Actions.

# Project Features
- Kidney Disease Classification: Utilizes machine learning models to predict kidney disease based on medical data.
- Experiment Tracking: MLflow is used to log experiments, metrics, and model versions.
- Data Version Control: DVC is integrated for managing datasets and orchestrating reproducible pipelines.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automates deployment to AWS with GitHub Actions, ensuring seamless updates to the production environment.
